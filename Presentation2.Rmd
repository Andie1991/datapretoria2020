# What does the user provide?
* A “headless job”
  * Not interactive/no GUI: how could you interact with 1000 simultaneous jobs?
* A set of input files
* A set of output files
* A set of parameters (command-line arguments)

---
class: left, middle

# What does the user provide?
* Requirements:
  * Ex: My job requires at least 2GB of RAM
  * Ex: My job requires Linux
* Control/Policy:
  * Ex: Send me email when the job is done
  * Ex: Job 2 is more important than Job 1
  * Ex: Kill my job if it runs for more than 6 hours

# What does the system provide? 

* Methods to:
  * Submit/Cancel job
  * Check on state of job
  * Check on state of available computers
  
---
class: left, middle

# What does the system provide? 
* Processes to:
  * Reliably track set of submitted jobs
  * Reliably track set of available computers
  * Decide which job runs on which computer
  * Manage a single computer
  * Start up a single job

# Large Jobs

* Let’s assume you have a ‘large job’
* What factors could make it large?
  * Large Data Input or Output or both
  * Needs to do heavy calculation
  * Needs a lot of memory
  * Needs to communicate with other jobs (whether required or not)
  * Reads and writes a lot of data/files
  * Heavy graphics processing
  * .red[Any combination of any of the above]

# Large Jobs
## There is no “One Size Fits All Solution”

* But some solutions are more ”Open” than others. 
  * Local Laptop/Desktop
  * Local Cluster
  * HPC System
  * Shared HTC Resources
  * Clouds

# Why is HTC hard?

## The HTC system has to keep track of:
* Individual tasks  (a.k.a. jobs) & their inputs
* Computers that are available 

## The system has to recover from failures
* There will be failures! Distributed computers means more chances for failures.



---
class: left, middle

# Why is HTC hard?

## You have to share computers
* Sharing can be within an organization, or between orgs
* So you have to worry about security
* And you have to worry about policies on how you share

## If you use a lot of computers, you have to handle variety:
* Different kinds of computers (OS, speed, etc..)
* Different kinds of storage (size, speed, etc…)
* Different networks interacting (network problems are hard to debug!)

# Surprise!
## HTCondor does this (and more)
* Methods to:
  * Submit/Cancel job. `condor_submit/condor_rm`
  * Check on state of job. `condor_q`
  * Check on state of avail. computers. `condor_status`
* Processes to:
  * Reliably track set of submitted jobs. `schedd`
  * Reliably track set of avail. computers. `collector`
  * Decide which job runs on where. `negotiator`
  * Manage a single computer `startd`
  * Start up a single job starter

# Not only Condor

* You can use other systems:
  * PBS/Torque
  * Oracle Grid Engine (né Sun Grid Engine)
  * LSF
  * SLURM

## What should you learn at the school?
  * How do you think about Computing Resources? 
  * How can you do your science with HTC?
  * … For now, learn it with Condor, but you can apply it to other systems.

# Quick Terminology

* .red[**Cluster**]: A dedicated set of computers not for interactive use
* .red[**Pool**]: A collection of computers used by Condor
  * May be dedicated
  * May be interactive

## Remember: 
* Condor can manage a cluster in a machine room
* Condor can use desktop computers
* Condor can access remote computers
* HTC uses all available resources

# Matchmaking

* Matchmaking is fundamental to Condor
* Matchmaking is two-way
  * Job describes what it requires:
    * I need Linux with 8 GB of RAM
  * Machine describes what it requires:
    * E.g., I will only run jobs from the Physics department
* Matchmaking allows preferences:
  * I need Linux, and I prefer machines with more memory but will run on any machine you provide me
  
---
class: left, middle

# Why Two-way Matching?

* Condor conceptually divides people into three groups:
  * Job submitters
  * Computer owners
  * Pool (cluster) administrator
* All three of these groups have preferences;
* .red[**May or may not be the same people**]

# ClassAds

* ClassAds state facts: 
  * *My job’s executable is analysis.exe*
  * *My machine’s load average is 5.6*
* ClassAds state preferences: 
  * *I require a computer with Linux* 
* ClassAds are extensible: 
  * They say whatever you want them to say

---
class: left, middle

# Example ClassAd

```
*MyType       = "Job"  # <- String
TargetType   = "Machine"
*ClusterId    = 1377  # <- A number
Owner        = "roy“
Cmd          = “analysis.exe“
*Requirements =    # <- Expression
   (Arch == "INTEL") 
   && (OpSys == "LINUX") 
   && (Disk >= DiskUsage) 
   && ((Memory * 1024)>=ImageSize)
…
```


---
class: left, middle

# Schema-free ClassAds

* Condor imposes some schema
  * Owner is a string, ClusterID is a number…
* But users can extend it however they like, for jobs or machines
* `AnalysisJobType = “simulation”`
* `HasJava_1_6 = TRUE`
* `ShoeLength = 10`
* Matchmaking can use these attributes:
```
Requirements = OpSys == "LINUX" 
      && HasJava_1_6 == TRUE
```

---
class: left, middle

# Don’t worry

* You won’t write ClassAds (usually)
  * You’ll create a simple submit file
  * Condor will write the ClassAd
  * You can extend the ClassAd if you want to
* You won’t write requirements (usually)
  * Condor writes them for you
  * You can extend them
  * In some environments you provide attributes instead of requirements expressions

# Why do jobs fail?

* The computer running the job fails
  * Or the network, or the disk, or the OS, or…
* Your job might be preempted:
  * Condor decides your job is less important than another, so your job is stopped and another started.
  * Not a “failure” per se, but it may feel like it to you.


---
class: left, middle

# Reliability

* When a job fails or is preempted:
  * It stays in the queue (on the schedd)
  * A note is written to the job log file
  * It reverts to “idle” state
  * It is eligible to be matched again
* .blue[**Relax! Condor will run your job again**]

---
class: left, middle

# Access to data in Condor

* .red[**Option #1**]: Shared filesystem
  * Simple to use, but make sure your filesystem can handle the load
* .red[**Option #2**]: Condor’s file transfer
  * Can automatically send back changed files
  * Atomic transfer of multiple files
  * Can be encrypted over the wire
  * Most common for small applications and data
* .red[**Option #3**]: Remote I/O

---
class: left, middle

# Condor File Transfer

* `ShouldTransferFiles = YES`
  * Always transfer files to execution site
* `ShouldTransferFiles = NO`
  * Rely on a shared filesystem
* `ShouldTransferFiles = IF_NEEDED`
  * Will automatically transfer the files if needed
  
```
Executable = my_job
Log        = my_job.log	
ShouldTransferFiles   = YES
*Transfer_input_files  = dataset$(Process), common.data
Queue 600
```

* Transfer_input_files can be a URL:
```
Transfer_input_files = http://www.example.com/input.data
```

# Clusters & Processes

* One submit file can describe lots of jobs
  * All the jobs in a submit file are a cluster of jobs
  * Yeah, same term as a cluster of computers
* Each cluster has a unique “cluster number”
* Each job in a cluster is called a “process”
* A Condor “job ID” is the cluster number, a period, and the process number (“20.1”)
* A cluster is allowed to have one or more processes.
  * There is always a cluster for every job

---
class: left, middle

# The `$(Process)` macro

* The initial directory for each job can be specified as `run_$(Process)`, and instead of submitting a single job, we use `Queue 600` to .red[submit 600 jobs at once];
* The `$(Process)` macro will be expanded to the process number for each job in the cluster (0 - 599), so we’ll have `run_0`, `run_1`, … `run_599` directories
* All the input/output files will be in different directories!

---
class: left, middle

# Example with `$(Process)`

```
# Example condor_submit input file that defines
# a cluster of 600 jobs with different directories
Executable = my_job
Log        = my_job.log
Arguments  = -arg1 –arg2
Input      = my_job.stdin
Output     = my_job.stdout
Error      = my_job.stderr
*InitialDir = run_$(Process)	# <- run_0 … run_599
Queue 600					      # <- Creates job 3.0 … 3.599

```

# Not Only Programming Languages

* You ran a C program this morning
* You can also run scripting languages such as bash, python, and perl
* You can also execute programs via the command like R 

---
class: left, middle

# Running Multiple Jobs

* Can vary arguments, input files, anything specified in the submit file
  * Options
    * `queue item matching *.dat`
    * `queue item in (a.dat, b.dat, c.dat)`
    * `queue item from list.txt`
* Can also vary pairs (or more): 
  * Queue param1,param2 from params.txt
```
$ cat params.txt
5, 2
4, 2
5, 1
4, 1
```

# Wrap Up Notes

* There are several different computing environments
* There is a very diverse set of computing jobs 
* Matching jobs to resources is key to not wasting resources
* Not all of the available environments are open environments
* Research Computing is Complex
